The goal of maldipickr is to provide documented and tested functions to dereplicate matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) data and cherry-pick representative spectra. 

This package is developed towards the spectra generated by the Bruker MALDI Biotyper. I am not associated with the company nor is this package.


## Installation

You can install the development version of maldipickr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
