- You are using the MALDI-TOF[^1] Biotyper to identify bacterial
  isolates
- You want to select representative isolates for further experiments
- You need fast and automated selection decisions that you can retrace

`{maldipickr}` provides documented and tested R functions that will help
you dereplicate MALDI-TOF data and cherry-pick representative spectra of
microbial isolates.

> Check out the graphical overview (click for a bigger version).
> `{maldipickr}` can use two approaches: 
> from taxonomic identification reports (left) or from spectra data (right).

## Installation

`{maldipickr}` is available on the
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=maldipickr) and on
[GitHub](https://github.com/ClavelLab/maldipickr).

To install the latest CRAN release, use the following command in R:

``` r
install.packages("maldipickr")
```

Or if you are using [`{renv}`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=renv),
use:

``` r
renv::install("maldipickr")
```

To install the development version, use the following command in R:

``` r
remotes::install_github("ClavelLab/maldipickr", build_vignettes = TRUE)
# or with renv::install("ClavelLab/maldipickr") 
```

## Usage

Start off with the [Introduction to
maldipickr](https://clavellab.github.io/maldipickr/articles/maldipickr.html)
for a quickstart. Otherwise, the comprehensive vignettes will walk you
through the package functions and showcase how to:

1.  [Import spectra data and identification reports from Bruker MALDI
    Biotyper into
    R](https://clavellab.github.io/maldipickr/articles/import-data-from-bruker-maldi-biotyper.html).
2.  [Process, dereplicate and cherry-pick representative spectra, from
    simple to complex
    design](https://clavellab.github.io/maldipickr/articles/dereplicate-bruker-maldi-biotyper-spectra.html).

## Credits

**Acknowledgements** This R package is developed for spectra data
generated by the Bruker MALDI Biotyper device. The
[`{maldipickr}`](https://github.com/ClavelLab/maldipickr) package is
built from a suite of Rmarkdown files using the
[`{fusen}`](https://thinkr-open.github.io/fusen/) package by Rochette S
(2023). It relies on:

1.  the [`{MALDIquant}`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=MALDIquant)
    package from Gibb & Strimmer (2012) for spectra functions
2.  the work of Strejcek et al. (2018) for the dereplication procedure.
