## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* fixed an issue regarding the clusters composition that needed an urgent patch (Thanks for your understanding).
* fixed the invalid file URIs in NEWS.md and README.md

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

The "Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION" corresponds to authors names or to scientific technical terms that have been checked again.
