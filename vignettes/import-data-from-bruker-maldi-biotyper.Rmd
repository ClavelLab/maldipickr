<!-- WARNING - This vignette is generated by {fusen} from dev/flat_full.Rmd: do not edit by hand -->

<!-- Run this 'development' chunk -->
<!-- Store every call to library() that you need to explore your functions -->


<!--
 You need to run the 'description' chunk in the '0-dev_history.Rmd' file before continuing your code there.

If it is the first time you use {fusen}, after 'description', you can directly run the last chunk of the present file with inflate() inside.
--> 


<!-- 
 Store your dataset in a directory named "inst/" at the root of your project.
 Use it for your tests in this Rmd thanks to `pkgload::load_all()` to make it available
and `system.file()` to read it in your examples.

- There already is a dataset in the "inst/" directory to be used in the examples below

# Importing generated reports from the Bruker MALDI Biotyper device

## Importing a single report

<!--
Create a chunk for the core of the function

- The chunk needs to be named `function` at least
- It contains the code of a documented function
- The chunk can also be named `function-my_median` to make it easily
findable in your Rmd
- Let the `@examples` part empty, and use the next `examples` chunk instead to present reproducible examples

After inflating the template

-  This function code will automatically be added in a new file in the "R/" directory
-->


<!--
Create a chunk with an example of use for your function

- The chunk needs to be named `examples` at least
- It contains working examples of your function
- The chunk is better be named `examples-my_median` to be handled
correctly when inflated as a vignette

After inflating the template

-  This example will automatically be added in the '@examples' part of our function above in the "R/" directory
- This example will automatically be added in the vignette created from this Rmd template
-->


```{r examples_read_biotyper_report}
# Get a example Bruker report
biotyper <- system.file("biotyper.csv", package = "maldipickr")
# Import the report as a tibble
report_tibble <- read_biotyper_report(biotyper)
# Display the tibble
report_tibble
```

<!--
Create a chunk with a test of use for your function

- The chunk needs to be named `tests` at least
- It contains working tests of your function
- The chunk is better be named `tests-my_median` to be handled
correctly when inflated as a vignette

After inflating the template

-  This test code will automatically be added in the "tests/testthat/" directory
-->


## Importing multiple reports

  

```{r example-read_many_biotyper_reports}
# List of Bruker MALDI Biotyper reports
reports_paths <- system.file(
  c("biotyper.csv", "biotyper.csv", "biotyper.csv"),
  package = "maldipickr")
read_many_biotyper_reports(
  reports_paths,
  report_ids = c("first","second","third"),
  growth_temperature = 37.0 # Additional metadata passed to dplyr::mutate                 
)
```

  

# Importing spectra from the Bruker MALDI Biotyper device

## Importing multiple spectra from a directory hierarchy

  

```{r example-import_biotyper_spectra}
directory_for_biotyper_spectra <- system.file("toy-species-spectra", package = "maldipickr")
spectra_list <- import_biotyper_spectra(directory_for_biotyper_spectra)
spectra_list
```

  

## Evaluate the quality of the spectra

  

```{r example-check_spectra}
directory_for_biotyper_spectra <- system.file("toy-species-spectra", package = "maldipickr")
spectra_list <- import_biotyper_spectra(directory_for_biotyper_spectra)
check_spectra(spectra_list)
```
