Bacterial colony identification with the Bruker MALDI Biotyper is a high-throughput method with the built-in tools, provided that the selected bacteria belong to the internal database.

Scientific projects where the number of unknown bacteria is expected to be high needs reference-free methods to be able to reduce the redundancy of isolated bacterial colonies, a process called *dereplication*.

[Strejcek *et al.* (2018)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.01294) proposed such a method by processing the spectra and suggest similarity thresholds between spectra above which spectra, and therefore the measured bacterial colonies, can be considered identical at a given taxonomic rank. Their processing procedure is implemented in the [`maldipickr`](https://github.com/cpauvert/maldipickr) package and illustrated in the following vignette.

In addition, we provide functions to enable the dereplication of different batches of Bruker MALDI Biotyper runs and combine the results, in order to be able to delineate the clusters from a common similarity matrix.

More importantly, we provide a function to select a spectra to be picked in each cluster, a process called *cherry-picking*, depending on external metadata and potential out-groups to be excluded for the current cherry-picking steps.

# Process Bruker MALDI Biotyper spectra

From the imported raw data from the Bruker MALDI Biotyper, the processing of the spectra is based on the original implementation, and run the following tasks:

1. Square-root transformation
2. Mass range trimming to 4-10 kDa as they were deemed most determinant by Strejcek et al. (2018)
3. Signal smoothing using the Savitzky-Golay method and a half window size of 20
4. Baseline correction with the SNIP procedure
5. Normalisation by Total Ion Current
6. Peak detection using the SuperSmoother procedure and with a signal-to-noise ratio above 3
7. Peak filtering. This step has been added to discard peaks with a negative signal-to-noise ratio probably due to being on the edge of the mass range.

The full procedure is illustrated in the example below. While in this case, all the resulting processed spectra, peaks and final spectra metadata are stored in-memory, the `process_spectra` function enables storing these files locally for scalable high-throughput analyses.

# Merge multiples processed spectra

During high-throughput analyses, multiples runs of Bruker MALDI Biotyper are expected resulting in several batches of spectra to be processed and compared.
While their processing is natively independent, and could natively be run in parallell, the integration of the batches for their comparison needs an additional step.

The `merge_processed_spectra` function aggregates the processed spectra and bins together the detected peaks, with a tolerance of `r format(.002*10^-6)` ppm. This binning step results in a $n\times p$ feature matrix (or intensity matrix), with $n$ rows for $n$ processed spectra (peakless spectra are discarded) and $p$ columns for the $p$ peaks masses.

By default, as in the Strejeck et al. (2018) procedure, the intensity values for spectra with missing peaks are interpolated from the processed spectra signal.
The current function enables the analyst to decide whether to interpolate the values or leave missing peaks as `NA` which would then be converted to an null intensity value.

# Compute a similarity matrix between all processed spectra (not included)

Once all the batches of spectra have been processed together, we can use a distance metric to evaluate how close the spectra are to one another.
[Strejcek *et al.* (2018)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.01294) recommend the *cosine* metric to compare the spectra and they use the fast implementation in the `coop` package.

While we do not provide specific functions to generate the similarity matrix, we illustrate below how it can be easily computed.
Note that the feature matrix from `merge_processed_spectra` has spectra as rows and peaks values as columns.
So to get a similarity matrix between spectra, the feature matrix must be transposed before cosine computation.

```
# Install the coop package
# install.packages("coop")

# Compute the similarity matrix on the transposed feature matrix
sim_matrix <- coop::cosine( t(fm) )
```

# Delineate clusters from a similarity matrix

When the similarity matrix is computed between all pairs of the studied spectra, the next step is to delineate clusters of spectra to dereplicate the measured bacterial colonies.

The `similarity_to_clusters` is agnostic of the similarity metric used, whether it is the cosine metric or the  Pearson product moment, provided that a numeric threshold relevant to the metric used is given.

Indeed, the matrix is transformed into a network without loops, where nodes are spectra and links exist between spectra only if the similarity between the spectra is **above** (or **equal to**) the threshold.
This representation allows to infer the clusters. A table summarises for each spectra, to which cluster number it was assigned to and the size of the cluster, which is the total number of spectra in the cluster.


```{r function-similarity_to_clusters}
#' Delineate clusters from a similarity matrix
#'
#' From a matrix of spectra similarity (e.g., with the cosine metric,
#' or Pearson product moment), infer the species clusters based on a
#' threshold **above** (or **equal to**) which spectra are considered alike.
#'
#' @param sim_matrix A *n*×*n* similarity matrix, with *n* the number of spectra. Columns should be named as the rows.
#' @param threshold A numeric value indicating the minimal similarity between two spectra. Adjust accordingly to the similarity metric used.
#'
#' @return A tibble of *n* rows for each spectra and 3 columns:
#' * `name`: the rownames of the similarity matrix indicating the spectra names
#' * `membership`: integers stating the cluster number to which the spectra belong to. It starts from 1 to _c_, the total number of clusters.
#' * `cluster_size`: integers indicating the total number of spectra in the corresponding cluster.
#'
#' @details The matrix is transformed into a network without loops,
#'  where nodes are spectra and links exist between spectra only if the similarity
#'  between the spectra is above the threshold.
#'
#'  The original idea comes from a [StackOverflow answer by the user
#'  ekstroem](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57613463). However, here the
#'  implementation differs in two way:
#'
#'  1. It relies on the connected components of the network instead of the fast greedy
#'   modularity algorithm.
#'  2. It uses [tidygraph::tidygraph-package] instead of [igraph::igraph-package]
#'  to stay within the tibble and tidyverse for consistency.

# Import clusters results generated by SPeDE

Raw spectra can also be processed and clustered by another approach, named [`SPeDE`](https://doi.org/10.1128/mSystems.00437-19), developed by Dumolin et al. (2019).
The resulting dereplication step produces a comma separated table. The example below illustrates how to import this table into R to be consistent with the dereplication table generated within the [`maldipickr`](https://github.com/cpauvert/maldipickr) package.
    
```{r function-import_spede_clusters}
#' Import clusters results generated by SPeDE
#'
#' Reformat the table output from the analysis of raw Bruker MALDI Biotyper
#' spectra by the SPeDE tool from Dumolin et al. (2019) to be consistent with the Strejcek et al. (2018) procedure followed
#' in the [maldipickr] package.
#'
#' @param path Path to the comma separated table generated by SPeDE
#'
#' @return A tibble with the following columns:
#'
#' * `name`: a character denoting the spectra name (all spaces, dashes and dots are replaced by underscores "_" in SPeDE)
#' * `membership`: integers stating the cluster number to which the spectra belong to. It starts from 1 to _c_, the total number of clusters.
#' * `cluster_size`: integers indicating the total number of spectra in the corresponding cluster.
#' * `quality`: a character indicating the spectra quality category by SPeDE, out of GREEN, ORANGE and RED.
#' * `is_reference`: a logical indicating whether the corresponding spectra is a reference spectra of the cluster.
