Description: Convenient wrapper functions for the analysis of matrix-assisted laser
        desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) spectra data in order to select only representative spectra (also called cherry-pick). The package covers the preprocessing and dereplication steps needed to cluster MALDI-TOF spectra before the final cherry-picking step. It enables the easy exclusion of spectra and/or clusters to accommodate complex cherry-picking strategies. Alternatively, cherry-picking using taxonomic identification MALDI-TOF data is made easy with functions to import inconsistently formatted reports.
