Title: Dereplicate And Cherry-pick Mass Spectrometry Spectra
Description: This package conveniently wrap-up matrix-assisted laser
        desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) data preprocessing steps, dereplication steps to cluster MALDI-TOF spectra and cherry-picking steps to select only representative spectra. This package relies heavily on the MALDIquant package and other tools to perform the actual work.
