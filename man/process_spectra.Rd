\usage{
process_spectra(spectra_list, rds_prefix = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{spectra_list}{A list of \link[MALDIquant:MassSpectrum-class]{MALDIquant::MassSpectrum} objects.}

\item{rds_prefix}{A character indicating the prefix for the \code{.RDS} output files to be written in the \code{processed} directory. By default, no prefix are given and thus no files are written.}
}
\value{
A named list of three objects:
\itemize{
\item \code{spectra}: a list the length of the spectra list of \link[MALDIquant:MassSpectrum-class]{MALDIquant::MassSpectrum} objects.
\item \code{peaks}: a list the length of the spectra list of \link[MALDIquant:MassPeaks-class]{MALDIquant::MassPeaks} objects.
\item \code{metadata}: a tibble indicating the median signal-to-noise ratio (\code{SNR}) and peaks number for all spectra list (\code{peaks}), with spectra names in the \code{name} column.

\description{
Process Bruker MALDI Biotyper spectra \emph{à la} Strejcek et al. (2018)
}
\details{
Based on the original implementation, the function performs the following tasks:
\enumerate{
\item Square-root transformation
\item Mass range trimming to 4-10 kDa as they were deemed most determinant by Strejcek et al. (2018)
\item Signal smoothing using the Savitzky-Golay method and a half window size of 20
\item Baseline correction with the SNIP procedure
\item Normalization by Total Ion Current
\item Peak detection using the SuperSmoother procedure and with a signal-to-noise ratio above 3
\item Peak filtering. This step has been added to discard peaks with a negative signal-to-noise ratio probably due to being on the edge of the mass range.

# Transform the spectra signals according to Strejcek et al. (2018)
processed <- process_spectra(spectra_list)
# Overview of the list architecture that is returned
